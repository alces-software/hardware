Considerations for Software and Application Deployment
======================================================

The deployment of the HPC platform can be boiled down to two main sections, these being:

  - Operating System Deployment
  - Repository Management

Operating System Deployment
---------------------------

When it comes to performing many operating installations across nodes in the network it can be tricky to find a flexible, manageable, automated solution. Performing manual installations of operating systems may be the ideal solution if there are only a few compute nodes, however, there are many other ways of improving the speed of OS deployment:

  - **Disk Cloning** -
